## Profile üìú:

I graduated with honors from Southwestern University with a Bachelor's of Science in Math and Physics in 2022. I obtained a fellowship to begin as a PhD student at Texas A&M University in the Fall of 2022. As an undergrad, I participated in three research experiences, traveled to Moscow to attend the Math in Moscow (MiM) study abroad program in 2020, (unofficially due to the pandemic) participated in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program, and completed an honors thesis project. I was the first SU student to attend the prestigious MiM program carving a path and opening a new opportunity for future SU students. I was also awarded the Ralph Whitmore Award in Mathematics and the Excellence in Physics Award as an outstanding senior in both Mathematics and Physics for my achievements in and out of the classroom. Now, I am a member of a cryogenics research group at A&M under Professor Nader Mirabolfathi where I am interested and do anything analysis related.
